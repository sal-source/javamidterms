A.Integrated Development Environment, is a software application which enables users to more easily write and debug Java programs

What are the IDEs available in the market to support java?
==> Eclipse, Intellij, NetBeans.

Explain the entire java life cycle.
- We write a java program and then it will be compiled by a Java Compiler. From there, it will turn it into a class,
which then goes through an interpreter. This translates the java code into binary machine code.
then it's outputted to the computer.

what is class?
- Are templates that are used to create objects, and to define object data types and methods.

What is object?
- Object is an instance of a class and the mother of all classes.

What is the entry point of an application?
- The main Method.

Why main is static?
- This is neccesary because main() is called by the JVM before any objects are made.
  Since it is static it can be directly invoked via the class.

Which class is the superclass of all classes?
- java.lang.Object

What is difference between path and classpath variables?
- Path is an environment variable which is used by the operating system to find the executables.
  Classpath is an environment variable which is used by the Java compiler to find the path, of classes.

What is the difference between an Interface and Abstract class?
- Main difference is methods of a Java interface are implicitly abstract and cannot have implementations.
- Abstract classes can have a main method not Interface classes.

Can you make an Object from an Interface and Abstract class ? if not how do you use it ?
_We can not make an object from Interface and Abstract Class. but we can make one from the subclaas (extends, implements).

what is Access Specifier?
- (public, private, protected). They are used to control the visibility of members like classes, variables and methods.

What is OOP ? Define each feature of java OOP.
- Object Oriented Programming.
  - Abstraction
  - Inheritance
  - Encapsulation
  - Polymorphism

What is Java Package and which package is imported by default?
- A package is a namespace that organizes a set of related classes and interfaces.
- Java.lang package.

What is API? Name list of API that you have used so far.
- Application Program Interface.

Does java support multiple inheritance, explain why or why not?
- java does not support multiple inheritance through class. to avoid ambiguity error.

What is method overloading and when it happens?
-is a feature that allows a class to have more than one method having the same name.

Explain exceptions in java and how to handle it.
- Exception is an error event that can happen during the execution of a program and disrupts its normal flow.
- we can handle it with a try and catch handle.

What is static keyword in java? How it has been used in variables and methods ?
- is the word used to share variable, method in a class.
- Variables: when a static variable is created its shared among all objects at class level. Static variables are,
 essentially, global variables. All instances of the class share the same static variable.
- Method: static method is associated with the class it self, not with any particular object. we don't have to create an object.

What is final and how it has been used variables and methods?
- final keyword is used in different contexts.
- First of all, final is a non-access modifier applicable only to a variable, a method or a class.

What is final, finally and finalize?
- final variable value can't be changed.
- Finally is used to place important code, it will be executed whether exception is handled or not.
- Finalize is used to perform clean up processing just before object is garbage collected

What is a constructor ?
- A constructor in Java is a block of code similar to a method that's called when an instance of an object is created.

Can we have multiple constructors in a class?
- Yes we can have more constructors in class with different variables.

If we don't have a constructor declared, what is called during the object creation?
- A Constructor by default.

What is "this" keyword in java ?
- THIS is a reference variable in Java that refers to the current object.

What is "super" keyword in java? How many possible way can you use?
- The super keyword in java is a reference variable that is used to refer parent class objects.
- super it can be used to refer to variable or constructor.

What is JVM stand for ?
- Java Virtual Machine.

Is JVM platform independent?
- Yes.

What version of java are you using?
 - 1.8.0

What is JAR stand for ?
- JAR stands for "Java Archive". A JAR file is basically a zip-file which contains a couple of class files and a text file.

What is the difference between JDK and JVM?
- JDK contains JVM and whole other tools for java development inside it.
- JVM converts bytecode to machine code and execute it on machine.
- There is no matching functionality between JDK and JVM.

What is the difference between JVM and JRE?
- is an abstract machine. It is a specification that provides runtime environment in which java bytecode can be executed.
- JRE is used to provide runtime environment.It is the implementation of JVM.It physically exists.

What is compile time and run time?
- Compile-time is the instance where the code you entered is converted to executable.
- Run-time is the instance where the executable is running.

What is heap?
- Runtime data area from which memory for all class instances and arrays are located.

How java manage it's memory?
- The JVM loads the code, verifies the code, executes the code, manages memory
(this includes allocating memory from the Operating System (OS), managing Java allocation
 including heap compaction and removal of garbage objects) and finally provides the runtime environment.

What is the difference between String, StringBuffer and StringBuilder?
- String is immutable, if you try to alter their values, another object gets created.
- StringBuffer and StringBuilder are mutable so they can change their values.
- The difference between StringBuffer and StringBuilder is that StringBuffer is thread-safe.

What is Singleton class?
- Singleton class is to control object creation by keeping private constructor.

What is Serialization and Deserialization?
-Serialization is a process of converting an object into a sequence of bytes
which can be persisted to a disk or database or can be sent through streams.
- The reverse process of creating object from sequence of bytes is called deserialization.

when to use transient variable in java?
- transient is a variables modifier used in serialization. At the time of serialization,
if we donâ€™t want to save value of a particular variable in a file, then we use transient keyword.

Difference between while and do..while loop?
- While loop executes the code block only if the condition is True.
- Do While loop, condition is tested at the end of the loop so Do While executes
the statements in the code block at least once even if the condition Fails.

What is Enum?
- Enum is a special Java type used to define collections of constants.

What is Iterator?
- Iterators are used in Collection framework in Java to retrieve elements one by one. There are three iterators.

Which one will take more memory, an int or Integer?
- they are the same, they represent a same value.

Why is String Immutable in Java?
- Once string object is created its data, it can not be changed.

What is constructor chaining in Java?
- is the process of calling one constructor from another constructor with respect to current object.

The difference between Serial and Parallel Garbage Collector?
- Serial Collector is mostly designed for single-threaded environments.
- Parallel Garbage Collector is used for multi-threaded environments.

What is JIT stands for?
- Just In Time compilation.

Explain Java Heap space and Garbage collection?
- The garbage collector is a program which runs on the Java Virtual Machine which gets rid of objects
  which are not being used by a Java application anymore.
- The heap is created when the JVM starts up and may increase or decrease in size while the application runs.

Can you guarantee the garbage collection process?
- No

What is the difference between stack and heap in Java?
- The main difference between heap and stack is that stack memory is used to store local variables and function call
  while heap memory is used to store objects in Java.
- If there is no memory left in the stack for storing function call or local variable,
JVM will throw java.lang.StackOverFlowError, while if there is no more heap space for creating an object,
JVM will throw java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java Heap Space.
- stack memory is a lot lesser than the size of  heap memory in Java.
- Variables stored in stacks are only visible to the owner Thread while objects created in the heap are visible to all thread.

What is reflection in java and why is it useful?
- Reflection in Java is the ability to examine and/or modify the properties or behavior of an object at run-time.

what is multithreading in java?
- Multithreading is a Java feature that allows concurrent execution
  of two or more parts of a program for maximum utilization of CPU.

What is the use of synchronization in Java?
- Synchronization is the process of allowing threads to execute one after another.

What is Framework?
- Frameworks are large bodies (usually many classes) of pre_written code to which
  you add your own code to solve a problem in a specific domain.

What are the testing Framework available in java?
- JUNIT, REST Assured, Selenium, TestNG, Mockito, Spock Framework, Cucumber, SpringTest, DBUnit, Robot Framework.

Difference between jUnit and testNG?
- TestNG is quite similar to JUnit, but with added functionalities and features such as parallel test execution,
  parameterization, and more. It is inspired by JUnit and NUnit.

What are the dependencies for this project?
-Sometimes, you may need to invoke methods in a test case in a particular order,

what is dependency injection in java?
- In software engineering, dependency injection is a technique whereby one object
  (or static method) supplies the dependencies of another object.

What is static binding and dynamic binding?
- static binding in Java occurs during compile time while dynamic binding occurs during runtime.
  private , final and static methods and variables use static binding and are bonded by compiler
  while virtual methods are bonded during runtime based upon runtime object.
